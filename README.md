# credit_card_fraud_detection

n this project I will be first making our redictions using Machine Learning Techniques then I will be using Auto ML Technique to do the same. I will be using PyCaret in this notebook.

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase
In this project I will be implementing Anamoly detection to detect whether there is any fraudulent transaction.

In this project I performed
Data Analysis
Feature Engineering
